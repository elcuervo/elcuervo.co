This year will be my tenth aniversay of being working. Yep, 10 years, that's a lot of time, specially if you consider that my first official work was to clean a cybercafe.
But don't take me the wrong way... i've loved each one of my jobs, i've learned a lot about being a professional, a teammate and a boss.

All my work experiences was pretty much the same: i go to the interview, some silly questions and go to work.
I've met great people who teached me a lot.

And then i was one year ago, great paycheck, easy job and working in the core of great multinational powering a [SMPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPP) system.
And one day that wasn't enoght, one day the work was not that fun, one day i saw myself in the same old spot, doing the same old thing.

Then a mail arrived, a friend of a friend was looking for someone to code [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language\)). I only have C, PHP and Python as my everyday tools, but i take that chance.
One small house in a common neighborhood, one cold basement as an enterview room and the thoghfest enterview i've ever faced. There was no psycologhist, no human resources guys... just badass developers with mad questions about the edge tech and things i've only read in wikipedia.

The truth is that i felt depressed after that enterview, i've felt that i was not enogh developer, that i needed to learn more... and i've loved that feeling. For the first time in years i realized that there's still much road to walk.
I was really surprised when they mailed me to do pairing for a week. I really enjoyed to pair with all of them. I've learn about TDD, git secrets and to feel like part of a team.

The week was over and they made me an offer... less money than i was needed at the time and less guaranties. I was scared, just moved to a new apartament and a lot of debts in the credit cards. But things like this happen only once so i take the chance.

Months later we moved to a new house, bigger, lighter and in a better location. Founding myself surounded by coding ninjas increased my skills, my open source projects and my ability to grow.
A relaxed enviroment with games, jokes and friends not only make me more productive also for the first time it makes me feel **really** part of something.
They teached me about Scrum, Lean Startups and Agile Development. [Cubox](http://cuboxsa.com) contributes OSS a lot and provides sponsorship if we want to. That's a big change from the places i used to work when you are just a number, just an asset.

When you work in a place where all the time you are being motivated with tech talks,  retrospectives and even gifts. Yeah, we have T-shirts and new clothes :D.
We do code reviews, debate with blankboards in every wall and talk everyday about the edge technologies in the world.

We play football, basketball and Paintball.
We drink beers and go out.
We also train together.

When you _work_ with real friends and outstanding profesionals actually feeling like working is hard, at least to me.
When you work the [Cubox](http://cuboxsa.com) way you ofter forget the work part and just feel it like the only way of really enjoying everyday.
