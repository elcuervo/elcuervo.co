title: Stop trying to take me out of "the zone"

I'm currently working on open source project, even on projects that actually
take money which is not very smart since I don't really have an income.
I've been doing this for almost two months and I really feel happy about this
decision... It's hard and complicated but I'm really happy.

I have something that I really missed... "the zone", that crazy state when you
are doing any activity (I only feel it while programming) when everything makes
sense and you become uber productive. It's incredibly satisfying and the results
are plain awesome. Ideas, code and quality beyond the "normal zone".

For a reason that I don't really know some employees **really** try to make work
something difficult. Programming is not about brute force nor linear
productivity. It's about creativity and understanding... and those are things
that don't work in your regular work schedule always.

Currently my moment of inspiration is starting at 1AM... really far from the
time any employer I had expected and that's good.

I love to work on complex problems in the simplest way possible, I'm really
stubborn and I'm only faithful with my beliefs. Most of my friends are developers
and I know they work the way they want, in the moments of day or night they
want.

I know developer who are not developers any more and they forgot that
outstanding feeling that is entering "the zone", where the code flows and
patterns are templates for the beautiful piece you are building.

Zed Shaw nailed it with Programming Motherfucker, we love to code, to create...
please let us do that in the moment of the day we want.
