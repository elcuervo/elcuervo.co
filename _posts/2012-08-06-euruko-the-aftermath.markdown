I had the great honour to go to EuRuKo one more time this time I was a
speaker. It was an amazing experience, last year as a attendant and now being
able to share my knowledge to all the people that year by year travel through
Europe.

Being a geek I took a lot of pictures by I choose to use the one with the
organisers as a main image for this post because that's one of the key features
of any event, especially EuRuKo.

For the ones that do not know EuRuKo it's organised by local Ruby groups and
it's been like that since the beginning. It's an incredible effort they make and
this edition was no exception on a great conference.
