A week or so I asked some of my twitter followers and some friends for advice.
I'm going to dedicate myself to open source for a while. Mostly to wrap up some
of my projects and probably try to improve some others.

The decision was a little tough to make. As everyone I need money to survive so
this will afect my savings. On the other hand I haven't been happier in years. I
do love open source and I can't see myself without it.

There were only one question in my poll: In which open source project should I
work first?

# The results

To my surprise this was the top 3:

* [Minuteman](https://github.com/elcuervo/minuteman)
* [Airplay](https://github.com/elcuervo/airplay)
* [Dashcat](https://github.com/elcuervo/dashcat)

I didn't really expected Minuteman to win the poll. But it did.

# The future

This is part of my plans for the future of some of my projects

## Minuteman
[https://github.com/elcuervo/minuteman](https://github.com/elcuervo/minuteman)

Even that it won it was not the first project I worked on since I feel that
Airplay needed a wrap up.

But anyways, the future of minuteman is reach the 2.0 version. This will
include:

* Anonymous user tracking
* Events counter
* Faster core thanks to a lua rewrite on some special operations
* A core lib that will open the posibility on implementing Minuteman in other
  languahes trivially

## Airplay
[https://github.com/elcuervo/airplay](https://github.com/elcuervo/airplay)

This is one of the most important project I did. Attempts to be a full featured
open source library to interact with an Apple TV

Is about to reach 1.0 with the following features:

* Custom node aggregation
* Grouping
* Serve local videos
* Video playlists
* Playback control
* Sample CLI

And the future is even more promising:

* Custom subtitules
* Custom audio tracks
* More device compatibility
* Hidden features control (eg: volume)

## Dashcat
[https://github.com/elcuervo/dashcat](https://github.com/elcuervo/dashcat)

I really, really like Dashcat. It was just an idea to have something like
twitter but for GitHub. It was a really naive implementation, a webapp in a osx
wrapper.

But the future is promising:

* Rewrite using PyQt
* Improved performance
* Organizations integration
* System notifications
* Pending PR
* View code and PR from the app itself

Well... that's a brief update on my open source life and some of the future.
