title: A day without Internet

I've found some beautiful things in the internet, some things that can make you
think a lot. This is one of them. What would it be a day without Internet?

This is just a pretty formatting of this [Reddit comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hfan5/if_you_could_get_rid_of_one_thing_that_is_vital/catsnvv)

## The story

After refreshing the page twenty-seven times and still only getting a message
informing him that he is not connected to the internet, Josef decides enough is
enough. He listens impatiently to the dull tone coming from his phone while
waiting for someone to pick up, his head swimming with angry words that he is
preparing to bombard whoever will listen with.

<blockquote>
"Welcome to Internet provider customer service. Please hold while we connect your call."
</blockquote>

A pre-recorded female voice says, almost managing to call Josef down.

<blockquote>
"Your place in line is thirty thousand three hundred seventy four."
</blockquote>

Well, I guess that's off the table then, Josef thinks to himself. He hangs up with as much rage as he can
put into the press of a button. Stupid internet. Stupid service provider. Stupid
queue.

<blockquote>
"Alright, so there's no internet."
</blockquote>

Josef says to himself and takes a deep
breath. What is there to do without internet? I could hit up some old friends?
Nope, I don't have their phone number, we just talk over Skype. I could watch a
movie. Yeah, that's good. Let me just torrent something good. Right, no
internet. Fuck it, I'll just go back on Reddit. No. Fuck.

Finally Josef gives up and turns on the TV, flicking through the channels
looking for something interesting to watch. He zaps through rerun after rerun,
thinking about how awful daytime TV is and casually contemplating suicide.

<blockquote>
"... from all over the world say they have been unable to connect to the
internet. Experts are shocked by this sudden problem and are at a loss for what
could be causing it."
</blockquote>

A news reporter says, finally catching Josef's attention.

<blockquote>
"Thousands of technicians all over the world are looking for the source of this
widespread phenomenon, but for now, nobody can connect. In other news, demands
for cat pictures and hard drugs have drastically gone up since this morning, it
seems-."
</blockquote>

Josef turns off the TV and sits in stunned silence. A world without
internet. What if it's not coming back, Josef wondered and started to panic. I
can't let that happen.

<blockquote>
"I won't let that happen."
</blockquote>
He told himself.
<blockquote>
"Some things are just worth fighting for."
</blockquote>
He grabbed his phone and pressed the buttons frantically while a plan
started to take form in his mind.

<blockquote>
"Hey man, if you want to help me get the internet back, meet me at the Community
Center in two hours. Bring everyone you can."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I'm sure you are all wondering why I brought you here."
</blockquote>
Josef made an unnecessary flourish with his hand, making things seem far more dramatic than
the situation called for. In reality, the spacious Community Center was normally
only used Tuesday mornings for a pregnant women's yoga class, but now it played
host to over two hundred people, cramming in to every corner of the room. All
eyes were on Josef as he began to speak.

<blockquote>
"The internet... is a beautiful thing."
</blockquote>
He began.
<blockquote>
"There is something special about being able to share things with friends on the other side of the globe.
About being able to find someone to talk to anytime of the day at a moments
notice. About being able to look at two people having intercourse whenever you
want."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Yeah, porn!" Someone in the back piped in to scattered applause.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Today, this thing, this beautiful thing, was taken from us. We don't know who
did this or why. We don't know what they want, but I know what I want. I want my
goddamn internet back."
</blockquote>
Josef slammed his fist on the table to tumultuous
cheers.

After the cheering died down there was a lot of awkward shuffling of feet, some
coughing and a lot of looking expectantly at other people, waiting for them to
do something interesting before someone spoke up.

<blockquote>
"So what exactly are we going to do?"
</blockquote>
Someone in the crowd asked.

<blockquote>
"Well... well, I don't know. I didn't get that far in the whole thinking yet."
</blockquote>
Josef suddenly felt a lot less sure about this whole thing.
<blockquote>
"You are welcome to come up with ideas of your own."
</blockquote>
There was a lot more awkward silence and
looking at others.

<blockquote>
"We could play Dungeons and Dragons?"
</blockquote>
A bespectacled man in the back suggested
to a few murmurs of agreement.

<blockquote>
"Now, how is that going to solve the problem at hand?"
</blockquote>
Josef ask angrily, but it
fell on deaf ears as the whole room was now discussing which tabletop
role-playing game was the best. A few people filed out the back, but the
majority stayed and the chatter eventually died down.

<blockquote>
"So, now that that's settled, we can focus on what really matters here, getting
our internet back. We need to take some drastic action to not only get the
internet back, but ensure it never happens again."
</blockquote>
There were a few "Yeah!"s and some homemade war cries.

<blockquote>
"We could make a pipe bomb and threaten to blow up a school!"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"First of all, we're not terrorists! We just want our internet back. Besides, do
you know how to make a pipe bomb without looking it up on the internet?"
</blockquote>
The man with the mighty mustache who had made the suggestion sadly shook his head.
<blockquote>
"Yeah, I didn't think so. And again, we need some non-violent methods here,
we're not terrorists!"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Well, I've always wanted to be a terrorist. I just never had anything to fight
for before."
</blockquote>

The mustachioed man said in a small voice. A young woman shot Josef
a dirty look and went to comfort the man.

<blockquote>
"Don't listen to him, he's just a meanie. Come on, we can go make pipe bombs
together."
</blockquote>
They left the room together and a few people followed them.

<blockquote>
"Alright then, if there are no more terrorists here, maybe we can get started?"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Any other ideas on how we can kick this revolution into over drive?"
</blockquote>

Josef asked the room at large.

<blockquote>
"I could really go for some lunch. I threw my breakfast sandwich at a wall in
rage when my computer wouldn't upload the picture of the sandwich to my blog, so
I haven't had anything in like, forever."
</blockquote>
A man in a scarf and glassless glasses said.

<blockquote>
"Oh my god, that's so funny! We should totes go for lunch!"
</blockquote>
A girl next to him said.
<blockquote>
"I know the perfect little place, you've probably never heard of it!"
</blockquote>
Another handful of people streamed out the back, leaving the community center
considerably roomier.

<blockquote> "I'll order some pizzas, just... stay here. Please." </blockquote>
Josef sighed.

When Josef return after the quick phone call another group had left, apparently
they went to play volleyball. The people started chatting and soon the pizzas
arrived, everyone threw in some money and kept mingling. As time went on more
and more people started to split off into groups, leaving the community center
for some common hobby.

<blockquote> "You alright there?" </blockquote>
A man with a big smiley face T-shirt asked and sat down
next to Josef who was sulking in a corner of the now almost empty community
center.

<blockquote> "I really suck at this, don't I?" </blockquote>

<blockquote> "What? No!" </blockquote>
The man said and laughed.

<blockquote>
"So what if we didn't get the internet back? I had fun! I never knew there were so many cool people in this city. I met
people who like the same kind of dogs I do, I met people I can play games with
or argue politics with, anything I want really, and it's all thanks to you!"
</blockquote>
Josef sniveled a little and looked over at the cheerful man, his smile matching
the one on his shirt.

<blockquote> "You think so?" </blockquote>
The man nodded fervently, making his double chins wobble, and
pointed over at the few people left, sitting on a table, chatting and laughing
while eating what was left of the now cold pizza.

<blockquote>
"Look at them, they would have stayed at home all day at their computers being
miserable if it weren't for you."
</blockquote>
The smiling man clapped a hand on Josef's shoulder in a fatherly manner.
<blockquote> "Well, I'll leave you to it then." </blockquote>
He said and got up to leave.

"Wait!" Josef got up after him. "Thank you." The man's face split into an even
wider grin and pulled Josef into a tight hug.

<blockquote>
"Anytime, friend."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Do you think... maybe we could do this again next week?" Josef asked.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I thought you'd never ask."
</blockquote>

That night Josef went to sleep feeling good about himself for the first time in
a long time. He felt like he had accomplished something and for the first time
in a very long time, he felt truly connected to other people. He didn't need the
internet after all. In fact, if the internet never came back, that would be
okay, was the last thing he thought before he fell asleep.

I wish I could tell you that the people that met that day kept seeing their new
friends and practicing their new hobbies. I wish I could tell you there were
regular Dungeons and Dragons get-togethers in the community center now. I wish I
could tell you the man with the mighty mustache became a terrorist like he had
always wanted. I wish I could tell you that - but this isn't a fairytale.

The next day the internet was back, and suddenly everything that had happened
yesterday seemed irrelevant. What's the company of a good friend compared to a
funny youtube clip? What's a new-found passion compared to an upvote? People
fell back into their old routines, spending their days on their computers, only
to sometimes remember, like a half forgotten dream, that one day in the
community center. What a strange day it had been. Can you imagine, a world
without internet?
