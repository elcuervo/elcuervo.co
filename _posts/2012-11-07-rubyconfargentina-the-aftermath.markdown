For the second time in a row I had the outstanding opportunity to
speak at RubyConf Argentina. This time I shared stage with people like Wynn
Netherland, Nick Sutterer, Jano Gonzalez, Steve Klabnik, etc which is awesome.
This talk is different from the other I gave, besides teaching I wanted to share
a feeling, an ideal. This is the story of an amazing conference.

## Speaker's day

Make the speaker feel comfortable it's an obligation for an organisation but
it's also an incredible hard thing to do. Somehow the "Speaker's Day" the guys
of the conference pull together was truly amazing. We spend a day together,
playing football, drinking and having a meal. A really bonding experience for
everyone.

## The conference itself

Anyone can cover the conference so I will not make you lose time on a review of
the talks, just make time to see the [Flickr Pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/rubyconfar2012/pool/)
and try to be there next time.
