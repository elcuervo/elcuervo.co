# Migration to Github
So, after many years having (almost) a blog i've choosed the best way of having one, using the incredible [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

I started the migration a few days ago and i found that for a developer like me having a git-powered blog is the only way to blog.

Just using the http://github.com/{username}/{username}.github.com repo will give you the ability of using static pages or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the best way of managing a blog.
