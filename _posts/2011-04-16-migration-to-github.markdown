summary: "My journey starting over a blog in a way i really like. The quirks and things i must do to make this blog what it is today.
So, after many years having (almost) a blog I've chose the best way of having one, using the incredible http://pages.github.com.  I started the migration a few days ago and i found that for a developer like me having a git-powered blog is the only way to blog."
